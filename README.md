## Activity

### Rules
* Student cannot remain in the same seat or the seat right next to them after the "My neighbor my neighbor call".

### Arrangement

1. Form a circle of chairs with 1 chair less than students. Students find a chair to sit in. The person without the chair gets in the center of the circle.

### On Your Mark, Get Set, Go!
1. Have the center student say "My neighbor my neighbor" [something]. Ex. "My neighbor my neighbor.. has been to California". The something that he says has to apply to him/her as well. Whoever has that thing in common must get up from their chair and find another chair to sit in. The person that doesn't find a chair is the next person in the center.  

### Next Round
1. The "my neighbor my neighbor" call keeps going until time runs out.
